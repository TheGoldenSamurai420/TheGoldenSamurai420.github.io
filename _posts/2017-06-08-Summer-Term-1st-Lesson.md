    <td>After the traumatic event of deleting our blog which I worked hard on, we had some restrictions regarding asking for help. I wasn't allowed to ask the person sitting next to us if they were going to do the task for me. I did sometimes ask the person sitting next to me how to do certain things but I did not need them to do it for me. An error me and the person sitting next to me found was adding background, I correctly typed the code for a background in the right place but it kept coming up as an error (I tried all sorts of ways to try to get it to work. The person sitting next to me found this issue on his computer aswell. </td>
