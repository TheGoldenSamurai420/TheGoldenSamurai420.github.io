    <td>First of all, Mr Keen had a bad ear infection meaning it was hard for him to teach us. Second of all the computer genius sitting next to me wasn't here. So I actually had to rely on the empty vacuum inside my head for information. I couldn’t use my emergency protocol which in my head is coded as
print:"Do you want to copy of some Bill Gates in the class. Yes, no or cannot”
(My choice was obvious and I cannot be bothered to type the code for my choice.)
print:”Do you want to get it off google?”
(Nah my non-existent brain got to have some use. Let's be the Bill Gates kid for once, just like the good old days when we got to make our own game on Scratch.)
5 minutes later
print:”Initiating brain core meltdown due to overworking.”
